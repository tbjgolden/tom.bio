    <h1>100 Days of Recruiters (UK&nbsp;Edition)</h1>

    <p>
      Like many software engineers, my inboxes are full of spam from recruiters.
      During these 100 days, my LinkedIn status was 'Closed to Opportunities'.
    </p>
    <p>Here's the highlights from the last 100 days.</p>

    <p>
      There were 300 (exactly!) total messages<br />(compared to 66 in the US
      edition)
    </p>
    <p>Here is how they contacted me:</p>

    <PieChart

        },
        {
          label: "Email",
          background: "#fff",
          value: 30,

    <h2>Bullshit Score</h2>
    <p>
      At first, I tried to count the occurrences of specific buzzwords... but
      there were just too many to choose from. Instead, I gave <strong
        >each message a Bullshit Score&trade;
      </strong>.
    </p>

    <PieChart
      client:load
      values={[
        {
          label: "No Bullshit",
          background: "#009900",
          value: 15,
        },
        {
          label: "Low",
          background: "#006600",
          value: 48,
        },
        {
          label: "Moderate",
          background: "#ff9900",
          value: 113,
        },
        {
          label: "High",
          background: "#cc0000",
          value: 124,
        },
      ]}
    />

    <h2>In-House Recruiters</h2>
    <p>
      15% of the recruiters were in-house recruiters, the rest were external
      recruiters.
    </p>

    <PieChart
      client:load
      values={[
        {
          label: "Internal",
          background: "#009900",
          value: 44,
        },
        {
          label: "External",
          background: "#cc0000",
          value: 256,
        },
      ]}
    />

    <hr />

    <p>
      Of the 256 external recruiters, only 31% were upfront with the company
      they were hiring for.
    </p>

    <PieChart
      client:load
      values={[
        {
          label: "Did name",
          background: "#009900",
          value: 67,
        },
        {
          label: "Didn't name",
          background: "#cc0000",
          value: 149,
        },
      ]}
    />

    <hr />

    <h2>Copy Paste</h2>
    <p>Yes, we know your messages are copy paste templates.</p>
    <p>
      One message I received this time was copy pasted, but they forgot to
      change the names and companies... ðŸ¤¦
    </p>

    <PieChart
      client:load
      values={[
        {
          label: "Mostly copy-paste",
          background: "#006600",
          value: 8,
        },
        {
          label: "Full copy-paste",
          background: "#cc0000",
          value: 292,
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      I make a point to reply to each message that was actually written - at
      least in part - by a human.
    </p>

    <h2>You Had One Job</h2>
    <p>
      These days I'm not much surprised when recruiters forget to list the key
      languages or tech I'll be working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise this time was that some <strong
        >also forgot to specify whether a role was Front-End, Back-End or Full
        Stack...
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>In this chart, incomplete means not specifying the job role.</p>

    <PieChart
      client:load
      values={[
        {
          label: "Adequate job listing",
          background: "#009900",
          value: 253,
        },
        {
          label: "Not a job advert",
          background: "#ffcc00",
          value: 42,
        },
        {
          label: "Incomplete job listing",
          background: "#cc0000",
          value: 5,
        },
      ]}

    <h2>The Quotes</h2>

    <p>
      Unlike their American counterparts, there were far less wacky attempts at
      recruiter clickbait.
    </p>
    <p>Instead, I mostly received hollow apologies for spamming.</p>
    <blockquote>
      I appreciate you probably get bombarded with messages from people like me
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      I can only imagine how flooded your inbox is with recruiter's messages
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      I imagine you've had a million messages (this is the 3rd alone from me!)
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      I appreciate you probably get bombarded with messages from people like me
      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>oh it's you again from yesterday</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I wonder why these folks keep spamming if they know it's annoying? <em
        >If only someone could explain?
      </em>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Apologies for the double messaging, I can imagine your inbox is full of
      similar messages, so I wanted to make sure you got this one!

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>i.e. I'm sorry everyone else is messaging you LOL</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      I thought I'd send you a follow up as I know you must get tons of messages
      / irrelevant spam and I wanted to stand out

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>at least you're honest</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Some really believed their own hype</p>
    <blockquote>
      I have just taken on a Full Stack Developer role within a company I'd
      consider modern-day Eco heroes.

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>
          <video style="width:300px" autoplay loop>
            <source src="/bs.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Your role is more than a Software Engineer

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>
          <img style="width:300px" src="/doubt.jpg" />
        </aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Yats are self-sovereign emoji usernames... Creators use our
      custom-designed emojis to compose beautiful works of art with deep, human
      messages.

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>A simple "Please join our NFT fraud scheme" would suffice</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Hi Tom, Let's talk about Intuit, the 2nd best tech company to work for in
      the UK

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>Let's talk about Intuit not bribing the judges enough</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And of course, there was a sprinkle of weird clickbait</p>
    <blockquote>
      Well, I can tell you that Cristiano Ronaldo's legs are insured for â‚¬100
      million
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The company could be described as a combination of Amazon, TikTok and QVC.

      <div class="aside-wrapper">
        <aside>Wish.com? Is that you?</aside>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
